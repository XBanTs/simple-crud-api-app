The simple-crud-app is a Node.js REST API application that implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for product management. Here's a brief overview:

**Technology Stack:**
- **Backend Framework:** Express.js v5.1.0
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM v8.17.0
- **Development Tool:** Nodemon for auto-restart during development

**Architecture:**
The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern with a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Models** (`models/product.model.js`): Defines the Product schema with fields:
   - name (required string)
   - quantity (number, default: 0)
   - price (number, default: 0)
   - image (optional string)
   - timestamps (automatically managed)

2. **Controllers** (`controllers/product.controller.js`): Contains business logic for all CRUD operations:
   - `getProducts()` - Fetch all products
   - `getProduct()` - Fetch single product by ID
   - `createProduct()` - Create new product
   - `updateProduct()` - Update existing product
   - `deleteProduct()` - Delete product

3. **Routes** (`routes/product.route.js`): Defines API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/products` - Get all products
   - `GET /api/products/:id` - Get product by ID
   - `POST /api/products` - Create new product
   - `PUT /api/products/:id` - Update product
   - `DELETE /api/products/:id` - Delete product

**Main Features:**
- RESTful API design
- MongoDB cloud database connection
- JSON request/response handling
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Development and production scripts
- Clean project structure

**Entry Point:** `index.js` - Sets up Express server, middleware, database connection, and routes. The server runs on port 3000.

This is a typical backend API structure suitable for learning CRUD operations and can serve as the foundation for larger applications or as a backend for frontend applications.
